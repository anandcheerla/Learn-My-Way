About


Have you ever scared of reading an article/material that you just come across when you are browsing.... Title is catchy, but the article is too big

Have you ever thought that you want to glance at an article inorder to get an overview, but tired of reading the entire thing... 

Have you ever thought that it would be better to read it differently rather than boring paragraphs which spans some pages and cheeky font styles to represent importance of certain information and the massive size where the probability to overlook is high...

Have you ever thought while you are reading, it would be better if we know where to focus/stress more, or which part is complex or easy to understand...It is not a news paper right!!!

Have you ever overlooked things/information that is required the most in understanding or learning the further details...


Even if you didnot think none of these, you can see what i have got !!!



This application is a learning platform.The main intention of the application is to make the reading/learning effective in terms of presentation,focus and efficiency. The learning will be in the form of articles which is some information that the people want to share/track/learn. The article is divided into small(very small and clear as possible)learning chunks with individual importance and level of complexity that is set by the person who prepare the article.
Based on the Importance the reader can decide which unit to focus more and which unit to focus less and which is important
Based on the level of complexity the reader can learn and understand what ever they want to in whatever pace they are able to...
combination of these two things makes the learning effective...

This application could be used in two ways.

one way, people can track their learnings that they have learned somewhere. Preparing an article with more emphasis on each and every small unit requires some good understanding and intuition, helps them to understand things even better...
Second way,They can post the same article, so that someone could read it and understand in the way you understood...By filtering the information, one can get the most out of it...


Large articles look terrifying to read and we might miss or dont focus on some useful parts of the article when it is presented in a paragraph view. Breaking the article into small pieces and as a separate units with more emphasis helps the reader understand well and makes it intersting.
