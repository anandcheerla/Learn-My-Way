          Have you ever scared of reading an article/material that you just come
          across when you are browsing.... Title is catchy, but the article is
          too big
        </h3>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Have you ever thought that you want to glance at an article inorder to
          get an overview, but tired of reading the entire thing...
        </h3>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Have you ever tired of reading boring paragraphs which spans few
          pages and stumped by the massive size where the probability to overlook is
          high...

        <h3>
          Have you ever thought while you were reading, it would be better if we
          know where to focus/stress more and which part is complex or which part is easy to
          understand...!!!

          Have you ever overlooked things/information that is required the most
          in understanding the essence of the entire article...

        <h3>
          Even if you didnot think none of these, you are welcome to check out

          This application is a learning platform.The main intention of the
          application is to make the reading/learning effective in terms of
          presentation,focus and efficiency. The learning will be in the form of
          articles which is some information that the people want to
          share/track/learn. The article is divided into small(very small and
          clear as possible)learning chunks with individual importance and level
          of complexity that is set by the person who prepares the article.
          Based on the Importance the reader can decide which unit to focus more
          and which unit to focus less and which is important. Based on the
          level of complexity the reader can learn and understand what ever they
          want to in whatever pace they are able to... combination of these two
          things makes the learning effective...

          This application could be used in two ways. one way, people can track
          their learnings that they have learned somewhere else. Preparing an
          article with more emphasis on each and every small unit requires some
          good understanding and intuition, helps them to understand things even
          better... Second way,They can post the same article, so that someone
          could read it and understand in the way you understood...By filtering
          the information, one can get the most out of it...
